# HKBU-Map
Android application project for helping students at HKBU navigate their way around campus.

### Intent
One of the problems that students new to a campus have is finding their way around and remembering all of the abbreviations for the various buildings and locations. The HKBU Map application was designed to solve this problem for students that are new to Hong Kong Baptist University.

### Future Work
1. Upload & submit indoor maps to Google.
2. Complete custom polylines using Dijkstra's Shortest Path alg.
3. Offline map markers.
